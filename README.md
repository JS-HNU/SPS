DNA/RNA barcoding technology plays a critical role in large-scale accurate species identification and classification worldwide. The Sequence Processing Software (SPS) developed in this study introduces a novel integrated workflow for DNA/RNA barcode analysis in one platform.

SPS integrates advanced support vector machine modeling with robust entropy-based algorithms and a bilingual and user-friendly graphical user interface, significantly enhancing the precision, efficiency, and usability of conserved-region identification and sequence analysis, thereby facilitating accurate and high-throughput biodiversity assessments.
